## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

**Pure Functions**

Here is a very strict definition of purity:

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
